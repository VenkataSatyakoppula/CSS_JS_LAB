Write the JQuery code to add behavior to the following page for 
keeping track of a to- do-list.
The page UI allows the user to type an item into a text box. 
The user can click the "add" button to add the item to the bottom of
 the list. Each word in the phrase should be inserted as a li, inside an ul
  with the id of list.If the user wishes to remove an item he or she can type
   the text of the item he or


she wishes to remove in the text box and click the 
“remove” button. This should be case insensitive. For example, 
if the list only contains “foo” and the user tries to remove “FoO”, 
it should be removed. If the user tries to remove an item that is in
 the list multiple times only the first occurrence should be removed.

The items should have background colors that alternate
 between white and yellow (first white, then yellow, then white, yellow, etc.). 
 This should still be the case no matter how many items are removed or added and
  no matter what order these operations are done in.The code should work for 
  multiple clicks of the buttons. On each click it should clear any previous 
  information you typed in the input boxes.
These screenshots show the state after items have been added and the state 
after items have been removed.
